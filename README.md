# OcuMOL_Leap
Incorporating the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion into PyMOL.

## Oculus Rift Only
1) Go on over to https://github.com/telamonian/ocudump/ and clone that repo. Follow the directions. 
    Be certain that your versions of the Oculus SDK and Runtime are identical. Be sure to run 'make ocudump_cython'.
    This will ensure you have the python libraries necessary to run our scripts.

2) Assuming you have PyMOL, spawning the 'prep_and_run.py' script from within PyMOL should send you on your way.
    If it doesn't, check to make sure your PYTHONPATH points to all the goodies. I set it in the prep_and_run script.
    Be sure to spawn the script and not run. Also, being in the the OcuMOL_Leap directoy won't hurt.

## Oculus Rift and Leap Motion
This will be coming soon. There's some issues to iron out.
