{"name":"OcuMOL Leap","tagline":"Incorporating the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion into PyMOL.","body":"### 3-D Visualization and Manipulation of Molecules with PyMOL, Leap Motion, and Oculus Rift\r\n\r\nThis is an **alpha** release of Python software for PyMOL which can be used to visualize (Oculus Rift) and manipulate (Leap Motion) molecules in 3-D. This software has lots of dependencies and peculiarities; it may not work instantly for you (it may not ever work for you)! However, it has been tested on a lonely MacBook Pro and we know it works on that so that being said, feel free to download and play with it, if you can.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nHead on over to the actual GitHub (https://github.com/lqtza/OcuMOL_Leap) for installation instructions.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis software was developed during HopHacks (Spring, 2015) by Jeliazko Jeliazkov (@lqtza), Max Klein (@telamonian), Henry Lessen (too-cool-for-GitHub), and Mariusz Matyszewski (@matyszm).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
