This software has lots of dependencies and peculiarities; it may not work instantly for you (it may not ever work for you)! That being said, feel free to download and play with it.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* Add soon.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis software was developed during HopHacks (Spring, 2015) by Jeliazko Jeliazkov (@lqtza), Max Klein (@telamonian), Henry Lessen (too-cool-for-GitHub), and Mariusz Matyszewski (@matyszm).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThis is very crude software. If you want to complain about the shape of the rocks, call the universe.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
