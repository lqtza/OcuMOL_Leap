This software has lots of dependencies and peculiarities; it may not work instantly for you (it may not ever work for you)! However, it has been tested on a lonely MacBook Pro and we know it works on that so that being said, feel free to download and play with it, if you can.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nThere are some tricks that need to happen.\r\n\r\n#### Hardware (obviously)\r\n* Computer\r\n* Oculus Rift\r\n* Leap Motion\r\n\r\n#### Software (you may have to install dependencies of dependencies)\r\n* https://github.com/lubosz/python-rift\r\n* https://developer.leapmotion.com/downloads\r\n* https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/\r\n* http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymol/\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis software was developed during HopHacks (Spring, 2015) by Jeliazko Jeliazkov (@lqtza), Max Klein (@telamonian), Henry Lessen (too-cool-for-GitHub), and Mariusz Matyszewski (@matyszm).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThis is very crude software. If you want to complain about the shape of the rocks, call the universe.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
